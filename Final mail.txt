Dear All,
As I move on to a new chapter in my career, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank each one of you for the incredible support, learning, and memories throughout my time here. It’s been a truly enriching experience — one that I will always carry with me.
A special note of gratitude to my manager, Roushan — thank you for being a constant guide and mentor. Your unwavering support, insightful feedback, and the unique perspectives you always brought to problem-solving have helped me grow both professionally and personally. I deeply appreciate the trust you placed in me.
To our VP, Asif, thank you for your motivating presence and leadership. Your approach taught me what it means to lead with vision and clarity. I’ve learned valuable lessons in leadership and resilience by simply observing how you handle challenges.
To my amazing colleagues Jyotsna, Abhishek, and Meghana — thank you for being more than just teammates. You were like best friends at work, and I genuinely enjoyed every collaboration, every laugh, and every learning moment we shared. I will truly miss working with you all.
I also want to extend a heartfelt thanks to Nandini and Sandeep for your support during the Member Grievance project.
