       "Peak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.\n",

Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.\n",

       "Implementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  \n",

       "Office Space\n",
       "Tembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, &amp; kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.\n",

       "Potential Conflict of Interest\n",
       "I would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power &amp; gas curves should be restricted.\n",

EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person.

       "\n",

       "Peak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.\n",

       "On the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.\n",

       "Origination\n",
       "This is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  \n",
       "\n",
       "IT\n",
       "Implementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  \n",

       "Office Space\n",
       "Tembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, & kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.\n",

       "Potential Conflict of Interest\n",
       "I would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power & gas curves should be restricted.\n",

I am 33 years old, have been inactive for 6 months.  I am 6' 1'' and 225 lbs.  I can easily ride 50 km at about 27 km/h on flat terrain.  I would like to lose 15 lbs, improve my speed an definitely improve my hill climbing ability.  I live at 3800 ft altitude and hill climbing is very difficult.  I hit lactate threshold fairly quick.\n",

I would think that the 2 week in march is good though.  Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n",

       "Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.\n",

       "As you know we will be calling our counterparties today to discuss the Court Case slated for Wednesday. I have created a spreadsheet that lists which counterparties you have been assigned to contact. It can be found at I:/Canadian Energy Services/Counterparty Talks.xls. Please keep it updated throughout the day. It is a shared file; therefore, more than one user can access it at the same time. Just hit \"F9\" to update changes other users have made to the sheet throughout the day.\n",
       "John - Can you please let your group know about the sheet and assign your traders to the counterparties listed under \"Traders\"?\n",

agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.  any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.  the only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.  the terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.  the pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)\n",

customer.  the pool is agnostic to what its participants do (i.e. generators that do 3rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool, consumers of electricity who do 3rd party physical hedges also pay the pool)\n",

       "quick question... from what i have read, it  appears as though the way the power pool works, the pool settles with the buyers  and sellers each month.  however,what happens when we contract with a  counterparty directly?  does the pool collect payment due for energy  delivered under a bilateral contract and then forward payment onto the  supplying party?  or does the financial settlement occur directly between  enron and the counterparty?  please advise,\n",

       "going forward we will be transacting with enron canada corp on an over-the-counter basis.  we will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  enron canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  we should be familiar with the alberta power pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from cdd to usd.  the lead or nw trader will provide enron canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.  \n",
       "\n",
       "enron canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  we need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (cdd) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.  \n",
       "\n",
       "further, enron canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the bc border.  they will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact wwp, ipc, transalta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  i do not see a need for this and i think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  if we are in contact with enron canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  be very clear in your dealings with nw counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  we are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.\n",
       "\n",
       "finally, i would like to see improved communication with enron canada.  it appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  i feel we can do better.  i want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ecc selling/buying from a counterparty in the us without our knowledge) and do not want the nw being scoured by both enron canada and enron north america.  this is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with enron canada.  this should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  if you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with enron canada, please let me know.\n",

       "has there been any real explanation why it is no.....  one small difference between the two is i am not talking about an equalization between c$ and us$ salaries.  mine is just simply a case of enron paying under market because they could in the past.  i don't believe that is the case anymore.  two years ago i was willing to accept less than market to see behind the curtain, but that is no longer the case.  i am not saying that it needs to be in the ubs document, but i would need your word you would do everything in your power to fix it.  if you can honestly tell me that i am paid the max. that is available to directors i will drop it. \n",

       "i am reading your mail, i have asked for the same thing regarding my base. especially since i came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 cdn/usd and with no raise since being here at 1.61 cdn/usd i have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in houston.  not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 usd/year lower than what other shops are offering.  however, after three attempts, i have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.\n",

       "just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  the only concern i have is with the base number.  seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  when i came to enron two years ago i took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  that is no longer the case (no options and ubs is not #1) therefore i would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  if you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base i would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with ubs.\n",

       "has there been any real explanation why it is no.....  one small difference between the two is i am not talking about an equalization between c$ and us$ salaries.  mine is just simply a case of enron paying under market because they could in the past.  i don't believe that is the case anymore.  two years ago i was willing to accept less than market to see behind the curtain, but that is no longer the case.  i am not saying that it needs to be in the ubs document, but i would need your word you would do everything in your power to fix it.  if you can honestly tell me that i am paid the max. that is available to directors i will drop it. \n",

       "i am reading your mail, i have asked for the same thing regarding my base. especially since i came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 cdn/usd and with no raise since being here at 1.61 cdn/usd i have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in houston.  not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 usd/year lower than what other shops are offering.  however, after three attempts, i have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.\n",

       "just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  the only concern i have is with the base number.  seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  when i came to enron two years ago i took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  that is no longer the case (no options and ubs is not #1) therefore i would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  if you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base i would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with ubs.\n",

mail, i have asked for the same thing regarding my base. especially since i came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 cdn/usd and with no raise since being here at 1.61 cdn/usd i have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in houston.  not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 usd/year lower than what other shops are offering.  however, after three attempts, i have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.\n",

       "just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  the only concern i have is with the base number.  seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  when i came to enron two years ago i took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  that is no longer the case (no options and ubs is not #1) therefore i would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  if you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base i would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with ubs.\n",

inactive for 6 months.  i am 6' 1'' and 225 lbs.  i can easily ride 50 km at about 27 km/h on flat terrain.  i would like to lose 15 lbs, improve my speed an definitely improve my hill climbing ability.  i live at 3800 ft altitude and hill climbing is very difficult.  i hit lactate threshold fairly quick.\n",

       "tim and john, i wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between eol and a trader having multiple trading books. eol has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. as a result, when creating the interface between eol and enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. david poston in the enpower it support group in houston has been working with the eol group and has come up with a solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. if you definitely plan to be trading on eol for all trading books associated with your name, eol it can define certain products to each trading book. if this is the approach that you would like to take, i will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. \n",

       "2. the other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. if that is the case, no changes will have to be made.\n",
