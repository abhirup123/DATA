1. getting data file contains code used to fetch data and create a dataframe.
2. data transformation file contains the initial data transfromation of sender name columns also called as file columns.
3. our next step will be to implement Name entity recognition algorithm on our first column to fetch all the name type of values and then use frequency based algorithm to find frequency of all type of names.
then to fetch the name pair we will implement some data transformation on body column and then can implement same name entity recognition algorithm to fetch all names type of values along with the pair.
and our last step will be find the meeting and business type of values from body column and along with that the occurences of sender name from file columns.



Note: please read about Name Entity Recognition algorith a.k.a NER algorithm.
